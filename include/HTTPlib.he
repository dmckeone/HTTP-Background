/* NON-VISUAL OBJECT TEMPLATE (HEADER)
 * 
 * This component is designed to show the basics that are required for creating a non-visual 
 * external object.
 *
 * NOTE: All headers for external components must have the .he extension instead of the standard .h
 *       To enable code-highliting in Visual Studio 2008 go to Tools->Options-Text Editor-File Extension 
 *       and add "he" as a "Microsoft Visual C++" experience.
